# gulp-dev
 This is my current setting of Gulp that I'm using for WP Theme development.
 
 To make it work open Gulpfile.js and on line 1 change themename and on line 74 change proxy address.
If you would like to test my FineDiv theme, make sure that theme folder is named "finediv". After just change themename to 'finediv' and proxy to 'localhost:8888/finediv'. If you prefer your own theme name dont forget to in your text editor find ALL 'finediv' and replace it with for you suitable name
